- Register a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). This will gradually become your identity as a programmer
    + Register for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)


- [Read about Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) so you can take effective notes with inline code. This website was written in Markdown and converted with Strapdown
    + [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is extremely useful for your first month or two and can be installed with `pip install ipython[notebook]`


- [Learn the Basics of Vim](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)

- Learn Regex [here](http://regexone.com/) or [here](http://regexr.com/)

- [Learn the Basics of Git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
	+ [Interactive Cheat Sheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;)
	+ [Printable Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
    + [gfixler's "Best practises"](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2fn4r9/how_to_work_with_git_flowchart/ckbdvnc)
    + https://xkcd.com/1597/ - "If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git." Here's my phone number: 0447 724 462

- Copy effective bug report formatting, like [this](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/1570)

- Use a linter, like [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/) or [Flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8)
   + Optionally, let Pycharm (`brew cask install pycharm-ce`) yell at you while you code. Be sure to start the project in PyCharm or else it will be too difficult to fix formatting at the end.

- For Assignment 1 in CSSE1001, you might be provided with an `assign1_sample_tests_1001.py` file or something to that effect. [This file should be run continually throughout the development of the assignment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

- You'll probably be using Python 3.4. [Typehint accordingly with awareness of 3.4's limitations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/)
    + `def function_name(variable_a: type, variable_b: type) -> return_type:`
    + Examples
        * `def and(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool:`
        * `def set_x(x: float) -> None:`
    + Python 3.4 does not support the [more elaborate type hinting system of Python 3.5. Ask tutors if you're allowed to use 3.5's syntax, as it might break their testing tools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
        * We can still use its syntax in comments, even if the interpreter doesn't actually check it
            - For datastructures
                + `Dict[str, int]`
                + `Tuple[int, float, str]` or `Tuple[int, ... ]` for a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type
                + `List[T]`, where `T` is any type
                    * Read up on generics [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html), [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses#type-variables) and [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/generics.html)


- Monads might prevent errors
    + [Rust has a very good implementation of them](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html)


[Learn to Unit Test with the unittest module and nose2](https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/12/09/improve-your-python-understanding-unit-testing/)


Structure a project like the following:

```project
    src
        __init__.py
        main.py
        module.py
    test
        test_module.py
```

`main.py` must use relative imports - `import src.module as module`
`test_module.py` - `from src import module`

Invoke `nose2` or `python3 -m unittest discover` in `/project/`
