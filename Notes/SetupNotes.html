**__Preface__**

This walkthrough provides instructions to quickly install and configure tools useful for programming on OSX and Linux. At times it can be quite opinionated, as I have written it for myself, hence annotations related to Arch Linux. You might find that my way is not the best way for you. 

If you do proceed to use this guide, note that there are four resources that will be essential to understanding this walkthrough, and effectively utilizing the tools it provides.

- [My dotfile repository](https://github.com/MaxwellBo/.dotfiles) contains all of my important configuration options. The zsh shell and Neovim text editor derrive most of their functionality from these files. It is continually updated to improve and cleanup functionality of programs.   
- [A curated list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) should be the first port of call when looking for software to fulfil a specific purpose. This covers a lot of what I consider "out of scope" of this walkthrough.
- [Unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) deals mainly with the A E S T H E T I C S side of setup. However, a lot of posts deal with effective workflow practises and utilities, which can greatly improve ease of use.
- [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) will help you develop your own set of configuration settings that you can carry around with you to different systems.

- Prelude
	+ **OSX**
		* `xcode-select --install`
		* **Install Homebrew**
            - Use the install script found [here](http://brew.sh/)
			- `brew tap caskroom/versions`
		* Settings
			- General > Dark menu bar and dock
			- Dock Hiding
			- Trackpad > Point & Click > Secondary click
			- Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboards > Move focus to active or next window > rebind to `Command` + `<backtick>`
	+ **Linux**
        * **Install Yaourt**
            * Append `[archlinuxfr] SigLevel = Never Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch` to `/etc/pacman.conf`
            * `sudo pacman -S yaourt`

---

For common, open-source CLI applications:

- OSX uses `brew install <name>`
- Arch uses `pacman -S <name>` and installs from the Arch Linux package database

For large commercial binaries, GUI applications or rare applications:

- OSX uses `brew cask install <name>`
- Arch uses `yaourt -S <name>` and installs from the Arch User Repository (AUR)

Ubuntu and Debian use `apt-get <name>` for both catagories of software.

Naming of packages may differ across package repositories. Unless otherwise specified, use the name used with the `brew` command. 

---

- Dotfiles
    + If you want to use my dotfiles
        * `cd ~`
        * `git clone https://github.com/MaxwellBo/.dotfiles`
        * `.dotfiles/install`
        * Use `git pull` to update them

---

- Fonts
    + If you cloned my dotfiles 
        * `bash ~/.dotfiles/Themeing/Fonts/PowerlineFonts/install.sh`
        * Install the font/s in `~/.dotfiles/Theming/Fonts/FiraCode/` by hand
    + If you didn't clone my dotfiles:
        * `cd ~`
        * `git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git` then `bash ~/fonts/install.sh` [Link](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
        * `git clone https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode.git` then install the font/s in `~/FiraCode` by hand [Link](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

    + What fonts to use
        * `DejaVu Sans Mono` I personally like the best for OSX and Linux. It has issues with the differences between `0` `o` and `O`
        * `Consolas` is the best option for Windows. It was designed to exploit the Microsoft's implementation of subpixel rendering
        * `Fira Code` has some very useful ligatures for functional programming. However the ligatures hide information to beginners, so I'll recommend the ligature free `Fira Mono` too. 
        * `Droid Sans Mono`, `Roboto Mono` and `Inconsolata-dz` are popular alternatives. I just don't like them as much as `DejuaVu Sand Mono`

---

- *OSX ONLY*
    + `brew install git`
    	* `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain` or [go here](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
        * `brew install lighttpd` for `git instaweb`
        * [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)
    + `brew cask install iterm2-beta`
        * Preferences > Profiles > Text > Change font > `* for Powerline` (required for terminal ligatures)
        * Preferences > Keys > To switch split panes > `Command`
        * Preferences > Keys > To switch tabs > `Alt`
        * Preferences > Keys > System-Wide hotkey
        * Preferences > Profiles > Window > Style > Full-screen Right of Screen
        * Preferences > Profiles > General > Reuse previous session's directory
        * Preferenes > Appearance > Hide scrollbars
        * [Themes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com/)
            - iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Colour Presets > Import
            - [I personally use base16-eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2) or [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) with the background set to 40-40-40
