This was written before I discovered the wonderful [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/). Somehow there was some strange convergent evolution going on and they ended up quite similiar. However, some steps and commands are either broken or have been made redundant by software updates. Furthermore, some of the steps and instructions are at odds with my own personal preferences, so I continue to maintain my own install guide.

My [dotfile repository](https://github.com/MaxwellBo/.dotfiles) can be useful for things like themes and sane defaults, so keep that open in a tab when you're running through this guide.

Before we continue, [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) should be your partner in everything you do. It is an essential tool for discovering your blindspots, informing you of options you never knew you had and an amazing educational procrastination tool.

- Prelude
	+ *OSX*
		* `xcode-select --install`
		* Install Homebrew
            - Use the install script found [here](http://brew.sh/)
			- `brew tap caskroom/versions`
		* Settings
			- General > Dark menu bar and dock
			- Dock Hiding
			- Trackpad > Point & Click > Secondary click
			- Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboards > Move focus to active or next window > rebind to `Command` + `<backtick>`
	+ *Linux*
        * `pacman -S  virtualbox-guest-utils` if you're running a VM
        * Install Yaourt
            * Append `[archlinuxfr] SigLevel = Never Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch` to `/etc/pacman.conf`
            * `sudo pacman -S yaourt`

---

`brew install <name>` and `pacman -S <name>` will install common, open-source CLI applications. Pacman will install applications from the Arch Linux package database.

`brew cask install <name>` and `yaourt -S <name>` will install commercial binaries, GUI applications or rare applications. Yaourt will install from the Arch User Repository (AUR)

---

- Fonts and dotfiles
    + If you want to use my dotfiles
        * `cd ~`
        * `git clone https://github.com/MaxwellBo/.dotfiles`
        * `.dotfiles/install`
        * Reopen terminal
        * `bash ~/.dotfiles/Themeing/Fonts/PowerlineFonts/install.sh` and install each font in `~/.dotfiles/Theming/Fonts/FiraCode/` by hand
    + If you didn't use my dotfiles:
        * `cd ~`
        * `git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git` then `bash ~/fonts/install.sh` [Link](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
        * `git clone https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode.git` then install each font by hand [Link](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)


    + What fonts to use
        * `DejaVu Sans Mono` I personally like the best for OSX and Linux. It has issues with the differences between `0` `o` and `O`
        * `Consolas` is the best option for Windows. It was designed to exploit the Microsoft's implementation of subpixel rendering
        * `Fira Code` has some very useful ligatures for functional programming. However the ligatures hide information to beginners, so I'll recommend the ligature free `Fira Mono` too. 
        * `Droid Sans Mono`, `Roboto Mono` and `Inconsolata-dz` are all effective alternatives

---

- *OSX ONLY*
    + `brew install git`
    	* `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain` or [go here](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
        * `brew install lighttpd` for `git instaweb`
        * [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)
    + `brew cask install iterm2-beta`
        * [Themes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com/)
            - [I personally use base16-eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2) or [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) with the background at 40-40-40
            -  iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Colour Presets > Import

	* [Follow the instructions here](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

From now on, I'm not providing the package manager invocation . You'll have to check whether it's a `homebrew` or `homebrew cask` recipe, or whether its in the official database (`pacman -S`) or AUR (`yaourt -S`)

		* Copy Gruvbox theme to `~/Library/Preferences/<IDE>/colors/`

        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`
        * `git config --global core.editor "nvim"`
        * Start `nvim` and `:PlugInstall`
        * If you installed YouCompleteMe
            - `cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe`
            - `./install.py --clang-completer` or `python2 install.py --clang-completer`
            - `pip install --user neovim`

        * Material for [Atom](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax) and [Sublime](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme)
        * 

    + NB: You're probably wondering why I've bothered listing four different text editors. Truthfully, I use all four for different purposes. I use Vim as a quick and dirty text editor for the manipulation of files in primarily commandline workspace. Atom has helpful features for web-development and an insanely high level of customization, but is slow, laggy and takes an age to respond. Sublime has great Markdown support and boots instantly for quick and easy text manipulation. Find a niche for each one, but install Vim bindings, similiar plugins, and similiar syntax highlighting schemes fonts for each one so as not to shock your brain each time you swap between them.

- CLI apps
	+ Useful: `ranger screenfetch tmux the_silver_searcher weechat  nmon lnav thefuck`
    + `pip3 install glances maybe`
	+ Look cool: `tty_clock lolcat slurm`
	+ [More](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12161/os-x-terminal-must-have-utilities)


- OSX Window Managers
    + `brew cask install spectacle` or `brew cask install slate` or `brew cask install divvy` or `brew cask install hammerspoon`


- i3 Window Manager
	+ `yaourt -S i3-gaps-git`
	+ `pacman -S i3status dmenu feh`
	+ [1](http://joaquinlp.me/blog/your-guide-to-a-damn-light-arch-linux-with-i3-and-text-apps/)
