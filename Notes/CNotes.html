**For C**

- [The C Programmming Language](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tezcci4jr4yxezi/TheCProgrammingLanguage.pdf?dl=0) (I'll email you a copy if this doesn't work)
- [Expert C Programming](http://www.electroons.com/8051/ebooks/expert%20C%20programming.pdf)
- [Beej's Guide to C Programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgc/) and [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/multipage/intro.html#audience)
- [C-Faq Idioms](http://c-faq.com/)
- [Linux kernel styleguide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle)
    + I personally dislike the Linux kernel brace style. Instead I would recommend [Stroustrup's extension of K&R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_Stroustrup) style, as it is similiar to functional whitespace languages like Python

**For C++**

- [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines)

- [Boost C++ Libraries](http://www.boost.org/)

> The actual C++ community at large has largely said that there's basically three "intro" or "learning" books:
> 
> - Principles and Practice Using C++ (the "College" beginner)
> - C++ Primer (the I've learned to program in X already beginner) and lastly
> - Accelerated C++ (the actual professional programmer and my boss said to learn C++) [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/470sh4/two_months_ago_a_playlist_of_47_c_tutorials_was/d09rkn0)
