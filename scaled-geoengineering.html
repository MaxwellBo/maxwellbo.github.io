  <h1>Scaled Geoengineering</h1>

  <h2>Proposal</h2>

  <p>Maybe there should be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection">Stratospheric aerosol injection</a> (SAI), venture backed, for-profit startup on Australian soil.</p>

  
  <h2>Legality</h2>

  <p>
    SAI is legal in the United States under the
    
    <a href="https://library.noaa.gov/weather-climate/weather-modification-project-reports#:~:text=Weather%20modification%20activities%20are,management%20activities%20and%20experiments">
      Weather Modification Act of 1976
    </a><sup><bh-cite>makesunsets2024faq</bh-cite></sup>.
  </p>


  <h2>Theory</h2>



  <p>
    Unlike the United States, <q>Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes an agreement to restrict climate geoengineering unless it is for small-scale scientific research, or unless the risks and scientific basis are appropriately considered (Decision X/33, 2010).</q><sup><bh-cite>bowen2024hansard</bh-cite></sup>
