  <h1>I am load shedding</h1>
  <b>15 April 2025</b>

  <blockquote>
    Rotational load shedding [...] is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown in which electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. Rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an electric utility company to avoid a total blackout of the power system.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I am completely overwhelmed.
  </p>

    I have:
    <ul>
      <li>
        13 unread text messages, that aren't OTPs, spam or miscellaneous alerts 
      </li>
      <li>
        3 unresponded-to handwritten letters
      </li>
      <li>
        8 unread on Instagram conversations
      </li>
      <li>
        28 unread Messenger conversations
      </li>
      <li>
        12 unread Instagram conversations
      </li>
      <li>
        4 unread WhatsApp conversations
      </li>
      <li>
       13 unread DMs on Slack 
      </li>
      <li>
       3 unread DMs on Discord
      </li>
      <li>
       4 unread DMs on Twitter
      </li>
      <li>
        1181, 3504, 1823 and 194 unread emails across 4 seperate Gmail inboxes
      </li>
      <li>
        1 unread MyGov notification
      </li>
      <li>
        1 outstanding peer feedback request on CultureAmp
      </li>
      
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I can't keep up.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I am doing the easiest thing I can in this situation. I am pretending that the social obligation to reply in a timely manner does not exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a shame, because for those who actually want to get in contact with me and value my company,
    my silence appears to be disrespectful ghosting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Best friends will persistently message, and try other communications channels to get a hold of me. They will undertand when apologize for being so hard to get a hold of.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good friends, new friends, long-lost friends trying to get into contact again, will not. They will back off, never to message again. Load shedding successful.
  </p>
  <p>I'm sorry, but I just can't keep up.</p>
