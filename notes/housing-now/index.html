  Building rates

  6 houses per 1000 in NSW
  8 houses per 1000 in Queensland
  9 houses per 1000 in Victoria

  <quote>Our cities are not museums</quote>

  Principles:

  1. Density
  2. Well located TOD
  3. social / affordable housing
  4. well designed and well built
  5. build as quickly as possible


  on social / affordable housing, $5.1 billion for 8400 homes (half to DV)
  607_000 for each home - lol?

  Bult 46 000 homes int he year to March

  22 months to complete in 2015
  30 months to complete in 2023


  Labor has been diverted to civil works

  Interest rates have 2x'd costs


  Report gives recommendations for going further

  <quote>"We're making it too hard, way too hard, for people to build homes"</quote>

  New planning reforms in the coming weeks

  Principles:

  Too many individual agencies slowing the down the system. Transport, Sydney Water, local government
  Queensland a leader here

  New SSPP (State Significant Planning Pathway) as a response to producitivty commisions report.


  Builders just can't turn a profit - construction cost higher than sale cost


  NSW beat every other state when it came to social housing rollout
  NSW government had concurrence powers during the Olympics
  


  Q: All the councilers want to focus on heritage? What are you going to do about that

  A: Not a reflection of the governments position

  big question dodge





  Will these council elections be a referrendum on the NSW gov's housing policy
  
  Q: are we going to compulsary acquire the racecourse
  A: No

  SSDA process (WHAT IS THIS) 


  Thousands of items of underutlized land (WHICH LAND?????) (landcom and land inventor)

  NSW Governments' 30% Uplift bonus (WHAT IS THIS????)


  <h2>What's the Vision for Australia's Housing System -- Marcus Spiller, Deuputy Chair, National Housing Supply Council and Affordability Council</h2>

  Essential not sufficient market


  A commercial motiviated developer has no reason to deliver affordable housing in well located areas 
  Filtering is erratic lmao

  3 principles:
  1. A refreshed role for social and affordable housing.
  2. Private capital, worth it even it comes at a higher fiscal cost to deliver affordable housing
  2. New schemes:Shared ownership coops, fractional ownership,
  3. Expand corporate landlordism / BTR


  Tenure taxation??? wtf is this???
  better tax privleges for those who choose not to buy a house / rent long term

  market failures ---> 
  
  planning systems:
  1. externalitieis of land use and development
  2. sequencing of infrastructure

  planning systems must maintain zoned capacity

  uplift taxes 

  <h2>UPDATE: The NSW Pattern Book - Paulo Macchia, GANSW Director, Pattern Book</h2>

  Goverment Architect New Sotuh Wales


  Engaging with market housing


  A lot of mass breaking


  Challening car parking count!!!
  Guaranteed approval if compliant with the pattern book

  Focus on non-wide lots, as wide sites are not common in Greater Sydney subdivision patterns

  Focus on cost cutting to make it easier for Garbage Trucks to pickup - current designs impart costs

  Exploring smaller lots


  fast track approval app software
  raft of legal issues - licensing, liability transfer


  3 pathwayd

  <h2>Q&A</h2>

  @ the minister, Rose Jackson, Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness: what worries you the most 
  A: time

  @ the minister: what do you have to say about the deparments you manage
  Optimistic about Homes NSW 

  <h2>Rose</h2>

  LANDCOM fucked
  Treasury very hostile to BTR (crowds out mom and pop landlords)
  LANDCOM in the orbit of the treasury

  <h2>Demolishing the Roadblocks to Housign Supply</h2>

  I will pick Chatswood and Linfield, not Rouse Hill
  Too much risk in NSW capital markets



  Q: Appealing to NIMBYs is a well worn path for candidates


  post conditions of consent (https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/policy-and-legislation/planning-reforms/standard-conditions-of-consent)

  use AI to approve things faster??? why did the councils set things up like this so that it's slow

  Grace Wu - I needed engineer from council, but the engineer was part time. 

  <h2>Mark Speakermann</h2>


  Can't put all the eggs in one basket (the TODs)
  Well rezone further outside the TOD radius!!!!

  feasibility - upzone in the East

  We support Tod, small o, small d

  "Give the councils right to organize their own development so they can preserve heritage"
  The TODs already preserve heritage!!!!!!!


  Stamp duty discounts on downsizers
  Land tax instead of stamp duty
