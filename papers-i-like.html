      journal = {Environmental Research Letters}}
      <!-- abstract = {We perform  engineering cost analyses of systems capable of delivering 1–5 million metric tonnes (Mt) of albedo modification material to altitudes of 18–30 km. The goal is to compare a range of delivery systems evaluated on a consistent cost basis. Cost estimates are developed with statistical cost estimating relationships based on historical costs of aerospace development programs and operations concepts using labor rates appropriate to the operations. We evaluate existing aircraft cost of acquisition and operations, perform in-depth new aircraft and airship design studies and cost analyses, and survey rockets, guns, and suspended gas and slurry pipes, comparing their costs to those of aircraft and airships. Annual costs for delivery systems based on new aircraft designs are estimated to be $1-3B to deliver 1 Mt to  20 30 km or $2-8B to deliver 5 Mt to the same altitude range. Costs for hybrid airships may be competitive, but their large surface area complicates operations in high altitude wind shear, and development costs are more uncertain than those for airplanes. Pipes suspended by floating platforms provide low recurring costs to pump a liquid or gas to altitudes as high as 20km, but the research, development, testing and evaluation costs of these systems are high and carry a large uncertainty; the pipe system’s high operating pressures and tensile strength requirements bring the feasibility of this system into question. The costs for rockets and guns are significantly higher than those for other systems. We conclude that (a) the basic technological capability to deliver material to the stratosphere at million tonne per year rates exists today, (b) based on prior literature, a few million tonnes per year would be sufficient to alter radiative forcing by an amount roughly equivalent to the growth of anticipated greenhouse gas forcing over the next half century, and that (c) several different methods could possibly deliver this quantity for less than $8B per year. We do not address here the science of aerosols in the stratosphere, nor issues of risk, effectiveness or governance that will add to the costs of solar geoengineering.}} -->

        abstract = {As functional programmers we always face a dilemma: should we write purely  
        functional code, or sacrifice purity for efficiency and resort to in-place  
        updates? This paper identifies precisely when we can have the best of both  
        worlds: a wide class of purely functional programs can be executed safely using  
        in-place updates without requiring allocation, provided their arguments are not  
        shared elsewhere.  
        
        We describe a linear _fully in-place_ (FIP) calculus where we prove that we can  
        always execute such functions in a way that requires no (de)allocation and uses  
        constant stack space. Of course, such a calculus is only relevant if we can  
        express interesting algorithms; we provide numerous examples of in-place  
        functions on datastructures such as splay trees or finger trees, together with  
        in-place versions of merge sort and quick sort.  
        
        We also show how we can generically derive a map function over _any_ polynomial  
        data type that is fully in-place. Finally, we have implemented the rules of the  
        FIP calculus in the Koka language. Using the Perceus reference counting garbage  
        collection, this implementation dynamically executes FIP functions in-place  
        whenever possible.},

         logic programming. Our main contribution is to equip VC with a  
         small-step rewrite semantics, so that we can reason  
         about a VC program in the same way as one does with lambda  
         calculus; that is, by applying successive rewrites to it.  
         We also show that the rewrite system is confluent for well-behaved terms.},

This new kind of sketch is robust with respect to skewed distributions, repeated samples and ordered datasets. Separately computed sketches can be combined with little or no loss in accuracy. An open-source Java implementation with no external dependencies of this algorithm is available as a free-standing library. Independent implementations in Go, C++ and Python are available. The t-digest is in widespread internal use in major companies and is also available in popular software such as Postgres, ElasticSearch, Apache Kylin and Apache Druid.
