  <h1>I am load shedding</h1>
  <b>15 April 2025</b>

  <blockquote>
    [Load shedding] is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown in which electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region. Rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an electric utility company to avoid a total blackout of the power system.

    I can't keep up.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I am doing the easiest thing I can in this situation. I am pretending that the social obligation to reply in a timely manner does not exist.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a shame, because for those who actually want to get in contact with me and value my company,
    my silence appears to be disrespectful ghosting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Best friends will persistently message, and try other communications channels to get a hold of me. They will understand when I apologize for being so hard to get a hold of.
  </p>
  <p>
    But good friends, new friends, long-lost friends trying to get into contact again, will not. They will back off, never to message again. Load shedding successful.
  </p>
  <p>I'm sorry, but I just can't keep up.</p>
