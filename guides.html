This was written before I discovered the wonderful [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/). Somehow there was some strange convergent evolution going on and they ended up quite similiar. However, some steps and commands are either broken or have been made redundant by software updates. Furthermore, some of the steps and instructions are at odds with my own personal preferences, so I continue to maintain my own install guide.

My [dotfile repository](https://github.com/MaxwellBo/dotfiles) can be useful for things like themes and sane defaults, so keep that open in a tab when you're running through this guide.

- Prelude
	+ *OSX*
		* `xcode-select --install`
		* Install Homebrew
            - Use the install script found [here](http://brew.sh/)
			- `brew tap caskroom/versions`
		* Settings
			- General > Dark menu bar and dock
			- Dock Hiding
			- Trackpad > Point & Click > Secondary click
			- Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboards > Move focus to active or next window > rebind to `Command` + `<backtick>`
	+ *Linux*
    + `pacman -S  virtualbox-guest-utils` if you're running a VM
    + Install Yaourt
			- Append `[archlinuxfr] SigLevel = Never Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch` to `/etc/pacman.conf`
			- `sudo pacman -S yaourt`

---

`brew install <name>` and `pacman -S <name>` will install common, open-source CLI applications. Pacman will install applications from the Arch Linux package database.

`brew cask install <name>` and `yaourt -S <name>` will install commercial binaries, GUI applications or rare applications. Yaourt will install from the Arch User Repository (AUR)

---

- Fonts and dotfiles
    + If you want to use my dotfiles
        * `cd`
        * `git init`
        * `git remote add origin https://github.com/MaxwellBo/dotfiles`
        * `git fetch`
        * `git reset --hard`
        * Reopen terminal
        * `bash ~/Themeing/Fonts/PowerlineFonts/install.sh` and install each font in `~Theming/Fonts/FiraCode/` by hand
    + If you didn't use my dotfiles:
        * `git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git` then `bash ~/fonts/install.sh` [Link](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
        * `git clone https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode.git` then install each font by hand [Link](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)


    + What fonts to use
        * `DejaVu Sans Mono` I personally like the best for OSX and Linux. It has issues with the differences between `0` `o` and `O`
        * `Consolas` is the best option for Windows. It was designed to exploit the Microsoft's implementation of subpixel rendering
        * `Fira Code` has some very useful ligatures for functional programming. However the ligatures hide information to beginners, so I'll recommend the ligature free `Fira Mono` too. 
        * `Droid Sans Mono`, `Roboto Mono` and `Inconsolata-dz` are all effective alternatives

---

- *OSX ONLY*
    + `brew install git`
    	* `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain` or [go here](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/)
    + `brew cask install iterm2-beta`
        * [Themes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com/)
            - [I personally use base16-eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2) or [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) with the background at 35 35 35 RGB
            -  iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Colour Presets > Import
        - Preferences > Profiles > Text > Change font > `* for Powerline` (required for terminal ligatures)
        -  Preferences > Keys > To switch split panes > `Command`
        - Preferences > Keys > To switch tabs > `Alt`
        - Preferences > Keys > System-Wide hotkey
        - Preferences > Profiles > Window > Style > Full-screen Right of Screen
        - Preferences > Profiles > General > Reuse previous session's directory
        - Preferenes > Appearance > Hide scrollbars

---

- zsh --> prezto
	* `brew install zsh` or `pacman -S zsh`
	* [Follow the instructions here](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
		- Between steps 2 and 3, delete `rm` all ``~/.z*`` files so that the script in step 3 can successfully create the required symlinks

- Development essentials
    + `brew install cmake`

- Python
	+ *OSX*

		* `sudo easy_install pip`
	+ *Linux*
		* `pacman -S python-pip` or `pacman -S python2-pip`
	+ *Both*
		- `<pipversion> install virtualenv`
		- [Usage guide](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide.html)


- Java
	+ `brew cask install java` or `yaourt -S jdk`

	+ Maven
		* `brew install maven` or `pacman -S maven`
        * [Guides](https://maven.apache.org/users/index.html)


- Ruby
	+ `brew install rbenv`
	+ `rbenv install -v <latest version>`
	+ `rbenv global <latest version>`
	+ `echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc`
	+ `ruby -v` to verify successful installation
	+ [Further steps](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Ruby/README.html)
	+ [This could be fantastically useful down the line](https://gorails.com/guides/using-vagrant-for-rails-developments)


- Web
	+ [Emmet](http://emmet.io/download/) for whatever text editor you use
	+ `brew install node`
	+ `npm install -g bower`
	+ `npm install -g coffee-script`
	+ `npm install -g grunt-cli`


- Haskell
    + Install `stack`
    + [Guide]( http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html#quick-start-guide)


---

From now on, I'm not providing the package manager invocation . You'll have to check whether it's a `homebrew` or `homebrew cask` recipe, or whether its in the official database (`pacman -S`) or AUR (`yaourt -S`)

        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`
        * `git config --global core.editor "nvim"`
        * Start `nvim` and `:PlugInstall`
        * If you installed YouCompleteMe
            - `cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe`
            - `./install.py --clang-completer` or `python2 install.py --clang-completer`
            - `pip install --user neovim`
                + Verify that this is installing to Python2.7 site-package directory with `pip list`, `pip3 list` and `which pip`
	+ Sublime Text 3
        * `brew cask install sublime-text3`

	+ Atom
        * `brew cask install atom`
		* Atom > Preferences > Packages
            - [sync-settings](https://github.com/Hackafe/atom-sync-settings)
                + `personalAccessToken: "077c26623ff9507be839052c9bcfc385a9f4c923"`
                + `gistId: "17076f01343d86f2417f"`
            - Themeing
                + Themes > One Dark > `Gear Symbol` > Layout Mode > Compact
                + Gruvbox by Caleb
                + base16-syntax
                + Change your font to `Consolas` if you're on Windows
                + [Add `Fira Code` support](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Atom-instructions)
            - Vim-mode
            - Ex-mode (Vim mode extension)

            - [More](http://blog.daniel-klose.com/technology/atom-editor-for-sublime-text-users/)
    + Global themeing
        * Material for [Atom](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax) and [Sublime](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme)

    + NB: You're probably wondering why I've bothered listing three different text editors. Truthfully, I use all three for different purposes. I use Vim as a quick and dirty text editor for the manipulation of files in primarily commandline workspace. Atom has helpful features for web-development and an insanely high level of customization, but is slow, laggy and takes an age to respond. Sublime has great Markdown support and boots instantly for quick and easy text manipulation. Find a niche for each one, but install Vim bindings, similiar plugins, and similiar syntax highlighting schemes fonts for each one so as not to shock your brain each time you swap between them.

- CLI apps
	+ Useful: `ranger screenfetch tmux the_silver_searcher weechat  nmon lnav thefuck`
    + `pip3 install glances`
	+ Look cool: `tty_clock lolcat slurm`
	+ [More](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12161/os-x-terminal-must-have-utilities)


- OSX Window Managers
    + `brew cask install spectacle` or `brew cask install slate` or `brew cask install divvy` or `brew cask install hammerspoon`


- i3 Window Manager
	+ `yaourt -S i3-gaps-git`
	+ `pacman -S i3status dmenu feh`
	+ [1](http://joaquinlp.me/blog/your-guide-to-a-damn-light-arch-linux-with-i3-and-text-apps/)

- Register a [GitHub account](https://github.com/). This will gradually become your identity as a programmer
    + Register for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)


- [Read about Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) so you can take effective notes with inline code. This website was written in Markdown and converted with Strapdown
    + [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is extremely useful for your first month or two and can be installed with `pip install ipython[notebook]`


- [Learn the Basics of Vim](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)

- Learn Regex [here](http://regexone.com/) or [here](http://regexr.com/)

- [Learn the Basics of Git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
	+ [Interactive Cheat Sheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;)
	+ [Printable Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
    + https://xkcd.com/1597/ - "If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git." Here's my phone number: 0447 724 462


- Use a linter, like [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/) or [Flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8)
   + Optionally, let Pycharm (`brew cask install pycharm-ce`) yell at you while you code. Be sure to start the project in PyCharm or else it will be too difficult to fix formatting at the end.


- You'll probably be using Python 3.4. [Typehint accordingly with awareness of 3.4's limitations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/)
    + `def function_name(variable_a: type, variable_b: type) -> return_type:`
    + Examples
        * `def and(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool:`
        * `def set_x(x: float) -> None:`
    + Python 3.4 does not support the [more elaborate type hinting system of Python 3.5. Ask tutors if you're allowed to use 3.5's syntax, as it might break their testing tools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
        * We can still use its syntax in comments, even if the interpreter doesn't actually check it
            - For datastructures
                + `Dict[str, int]`
                + `Tuple[int, float, str]` or `Tuple[int, ... ]` for a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type
                + `List[T]`, where `T` is any type
                    * Read up on generics [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html), [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/types-and-typeclasses#type-variables) and [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/generics.html)


- Monads might prevent errors
    + [Rust has a very good implementation of them](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html)


[Learn to Unit Test with the unittest module and nose2](https://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/12/09/improve-your-python-understanding-unit-testing/)


Structure a project like the following:

```project
    src
        __init__.py
        main.py
        module.py
    test
        test_module.py
```

`main.py` must use relative imports - `import src.module as module`
`test_module.py` - `from src import module`

Invoke `nose2` or `python3 -m unittest discover` in `/project/`
